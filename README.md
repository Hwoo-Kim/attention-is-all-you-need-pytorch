# Final Project for AI Chemistry

You need to check following files:
train.py, Models.py, Layers.py, SubLayers.py, Modules.py

There is an example how to use Transformer class at the bottom of train.py


# Attention is all you need: A Pytorch Implementation

This is a PyTorch implementation of the Transformer model in "[Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)" (Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser, Illia Polosukhin, arxiv, 2017). 


A novel sequence to sequence framework utilizes the **self-attention mechanism**, instead of Convolution operation or Recurrent structure, and achieve the state-of-the-art performance on **WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task**. (2017/06/12)

> The official Tensorflow Implementation can be found in: [tensorflow/tensor2tensor](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/blob/master/tensor2tensor/models/transformer.py).

> To learn more about self-attention mechanism, you could read "[A Structured Self-attentive Sentence Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03130)".

The project support training and translation with trained model now.

Note that this project is still a work in progress.
